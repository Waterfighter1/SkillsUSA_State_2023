                <h3 class="Question">Will you take my animal in?</h3>
                <p class="Answer"> First thing we ask no matter what, “Where do you live?” If you do
                    not live in the city limits they cannot bring an animal in. If animal is found within the city
                    limits, they have to now sign an affidavit that they found the dog inside the city limits, we have
                    those forms at the shelter. We are no longer accepting cats unless they are critically injured/sick
                    or 'without a mother. Any person in the County portion of Wilson County needing animal
                    control can call them at 615-444-9775. New Leash on Life may be able to help with some cats
                    and dogs they are 615-444-1144. Country K-9 is in Lebanon and they can sometimes help with
                    cats but mainly just dogs.</p>
